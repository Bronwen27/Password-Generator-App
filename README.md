# Password Generator App

## User Story
 
As a user I am looking to use the webpage to generate a random password based on criteria shown within the prompt pop up box. This app will run in the browser, and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code. 

* I generate a password when the button is clicked. 

* I answer a series of prompts describing the password criteria including; length of password between 10-64 characters, lowercase, uppercase, numeric and special characters. 

* Once prompts are answered then the password should be generated and displayed in an alert or written to the page
 


## Description

I have used HTML, CSS and JavaScript to create a password generator. The console can be inspected to see the process of elimination and selection of characters within their strings.
